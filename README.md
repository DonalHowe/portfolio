# My Portfolio projects

## Thesis, A comparison between Dstar Lite against various guided and non-guided pathfinding algorithms
Each of the chosen pathfinding algorithms were devloped in SFML using C++ as the coding language They were run on a 2D Grid of Cells/Node which all hold their own information the grid can change sizes ranging from a 10x10 grid to a 100x100 sized grid. The User is free to place down as many walls on the grid as they so wish,they can then run the algorithm which they choose on the grid.The algorithms available are Astar search algorithm, Dijkstras search algorithm, Dstar Lite search algorithm, Lifelong Planning Astar search algorithm, Jump Point search pathfinding algorithm and Depth first Search pathfinding algorithm. The User can then select whether they want to see the algorithm of their choice run against Dstar lite which is run on a seperate screen using the same start and endpoints which they choose. They also have the option to run Dstar Lite in debug mode which will show all of the variable changes which Dstar Lite causes on the grid.

## Not so Fantastic Mr Fox/ breadth first search game
This game was designed around implementing the pathfinding algorithim breadth first search where the game runs the algorithim and the farmer follows along the most 
suitable path , while the player playing as the fox must interact with all of the chickens before the farmer realises that they are gone.
## Assembly project/ Rabbids vs Plumbers
This is a text based fighting game based in assembly where the player wil go through a number of rooms to eventually fight the boss and get the loot at the end

## Shadows Game
The shadows game is a c++ desgined game where the player has to avoid the light and stay in the shadows 

## OpenGL  CubeField
This game is designed using 3D Graphics where the player has to avoid the oncoming cubes to win the game if the player hits off of the oncoming cubes their health will be decremented

## Tank Game
In this game the player controls the tank and have to avoid being seen by the patrolling tank and if the enemy tank spots you inside of tehir vision cone they will then track you to kill you  

## Dungeon Crawler
This game is a culmination of everything that i learned throughout my third year course, for instance it utilises many differnt types of data structures from stacks,queues, vectors and lists. it also utilises the my knowledge surrounding pathfinding algorithms by using the Astar algorithm.The game has four different levels excluding the menu and its different tabs/windows inside of the menu, as well as an inventory screen inside of the game.

## Unity Mobile Game
This game uses C# and is playable on mobile for anyone who wants to play the objective of the game is to use your graple to get from one part of the level to the other and avoid the bombs being dropped by an enemy type and kill the other with your attack.
